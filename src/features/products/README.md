### **1. Products Feature**
#### Purpose:
To manage product search and listing functionalities. This includes searching by barcode or name, displaying available products, and interacting with the products' information.

#### Components:
- **ProductSearch.tsx**: Provides input fields for searching products.
- **ProductList.tsx**: Displays the list of products.

#### Containers:
- **ProductSearchContainer.tsx**: Manages the business logic for product search.
  - Handles API calls for product search (name/barcode).
  - Validates input and manages search results via Redux.
  - Error handling for invalid inputs or empty search results.
  
- **ProductListContainer.tsx**: Manages product list logic.
  - Fetches product data and passes it to `ProductList`.
  - Handles pagination, sorting, or filtering of the products.
  
#### Redux:
- **productsSlice.ts**: 
  - Actions: `fetchProducts`, `searchProducts`.
  - State: `products`, `searchQuery`, `loading`, `error`.
  - Reducers to update the state based on search results.

#### Services:
- **productServices.ts**: Handles external API calls for product data retrieval and search (via Axios).
  - `getProducts()`: Fetches the list of products.
  - `searchProductsByBarcode()`: Searches for a product via barcode.
  - `searchProductsByName()`: Searches for a product via name.

#### Step-by-Step:
1. Design and implement the **UI components**: `ProductSearch` and `ProductList`.
2. Write **containers** to manage product-related logic.
3. Define the **Redux slice** for managing productsâ€™ state.
4. Integrate with the **services** to fetch product data from the backend.
5. Set up **unit tests** for Redux actions and reducers.
